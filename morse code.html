<p>I have created a device with all the instruments provided which will be a music player to outside world but just by the click of a single button, we can convert it to a Morse code decoder used to receive messages in the form of morse code. In its music player I have programmed it to play 2 songs “ “ and “ “, and in its second form it will convert the messages received to it in the form of Morse code and display it through a LED light used in the circuit. </p>
